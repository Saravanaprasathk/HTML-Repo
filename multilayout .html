            Even ten years ago, Indians might not have felt the same way as ccount fDaniel. Today, many of them do. Indians have achieved success in cities like Singapore, Sydney and London. They have run global institutions and even other nations. Middle-class Indians are often world-class. They want their own cities to be world-class, not trash towns that seem war-ravaged and shell-shocked.

       <p class="content2">Mobile sources account for more than half of all the air pollution in the United States and the primary mobile source of air pollution is the automobile, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Stationary sources, like power plants, emit large amounts of pollution from a single location, these are also known as point sources of pollution. Area sources are made up of lots of smaller pollution sources that aren't a big deal by themselves but when considered as a group can be. Natural sources can sometimes be significant but do not usually create ongoing air pollution problems like the other source types can.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSA_7CdOnewmLxyG8VrnPj470RlbLP3kUwW7zeLu2gz2RTHx5IQdNVYoxyALqDCyKtXiFs&usqp=CAU" height="170px" width="190px"></p>

           <p class="content3">Parks downwind of power plants that lack modern pollution controls can have increased smog. Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks, as well as industrial processes such as oil and gas development, give rise to elevated ozone concentrations. Summertime wildfires can also reduce visibility in NPS areas. There are even examples of pollutants that originated from other countries and were transported thousands of miles arriving at parks. The effects of this pollution can be seen as haze and through negative biological effects. Learn more about effects of air pollution on nature and visibility, and human health.<hr></p>
