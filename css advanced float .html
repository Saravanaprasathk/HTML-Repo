     <h2>FOOTBALL OF LEGENDS </h2>
     <p class="p1">On April 29, 1990, Napoli won their second, and so far last, Serie A title. It was at home and after a 1-0 win against Lazio in their last match, the battle with AC Milan having gone down to the wire. The only goal came in the seventh minute, central defender Marco Baroni heading home a Diego Maradona free-kick, ending another Italian season shrouded in controversy but also one that heralded the arrival of Gianfranco Zola.</p>

     <p class="p2">“This is proof that I know myself better than anyone!,” Maradona screamed after the final whistle. “And this is the down payment to be allowed to live my life! I want to live my life, please,” he wrote in El Diego, the autobiography translated into English by Marcela Mora Y Araujo. No one knew better than Maradona that being famous and “living my life” were like opposite-coloured bishops in chess.

        Reluctant star
        How else can you explain that Napoli’s last league title came when Maradona wasn’t even supposed to play for them? To get Maradona to Olympique Marseille, Bernard Tapie had promised riches beyond the imagination of a footballer in the 1980s. Maradona’s annual salary of $12m would be doubled, he would stay in a villa “with a 6000m park for my daughter (Dalma) to run around in, for my family to enjoy, with a swimming pool. (El Diego).”</p>

    <p class="p3">Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri is arguably one of the greatest footballer India has ever produced. Chhetri's remarkable accomplishments and contribution to the sport have made him one of I . . . It was critically important for the national team to secure their place in Pot 2, as it was hanging in the balance going into the finals of the SAFF Championship. India needed to avoid loss in regular . . .
