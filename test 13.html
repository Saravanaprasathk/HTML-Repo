    <p>Nature For Justice works with trusted local partners and investors to identify and co-create projects that use nature-based solutions to achieve social justice.

        While we utilize carbon markets, they are not our sole method for securing lasting financial support. We aim to fund community-led conservation and nature-based solutions that enhance both human lives and their environments.</p>
